# sinatra-with-users 
A basic sinatra application with the basic amenities a user might expect.

Now with AJAX!

## Basic Functionality

Users can:

- Create an account.

- Login/Logout.

- Edit the account information.

- Delete the account.

Basic error messages will be shown under related fields when there are validation errors. 

## Extended Functionality

If users have javascript enabled, error messages -- or, conversely, messages letting the user know how perfect their field inputs are -- will be displayed on the fly. This will not effect normal validation should the user submit a form with bad input data.

## Ideas
Let me know if you have any feedback. Im a newbie and would relish any chance to improve on any topic here.

## Requirements

I received varying levels of inspiration and guidance from the following sources:

Additionally, I got some ideas from the following two github repos:

I might have forgotten someone. Sorry if I did!
